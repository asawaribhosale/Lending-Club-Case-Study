## General Information

We are working for Lending club a finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. <br> Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: <br> •If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company <br> •If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
<br> 

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants,then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. <br>

Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
